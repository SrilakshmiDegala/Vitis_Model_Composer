# Designs with AI Engine and imported RTL

This example demonstrates co- simulation of AI Engines and imported RTL.

## Knowledge nuggets

:bulb: The inputs to the HDL domain and the outputs of the HDL domain are always scalar signals. 

:bulb: When the output of the AI Engine block is a vector, the HDL domain must be sampled at a higher sampling rate or else the internal memory of the *AIE to HDL block* will overflow. This happens as the HDL design will put back pressure on the AIE to HDL block by setting tready signal to zero.

:bulb: In this example, the input to the interface block has a period of 128. Since the input size is 256, then the sample time is 128/256=.5. So the sample time of the HDL domain should be at most .5 to avoid memory overflow in the *AIE to HDL block*. The sampling time of the HDL domain is set in the *Input Gateway* blocks.

:bulb: Moreover, the design in the HDL domain has an initiation interval of 19. In other words, it takes 19 cycles before the input can accept a new sample. As such, we need to further reduce the sample time by a factor of at least 19 to avoid memory overflow in the *AIE to HDL* interface block. In this example we set the sample time to .5/20.
