# Designs with AI Engine and HDL blocks

In this example, we are connecting an AI Engine block to an *AXI FIFO* HDL block. Note that the output of the AI Engine 
block is a vector of size 8 with and a period of 8 (i.e. one sample per second).

## Knowledge nuggets

:bulb: The inputs to the HDL domain and the outputs of the HDL domain are always scaler signals. 

:bulb: When the output of the AI Engine block is a vector, the HDL domain must be sampled at a higher sampling rate or else the internal memory of the AIE to HDL block will overflow.
In this example, the HDL domain is sampled at 8 times higher than the AI Engine domain. The sampling time of the HDL domain is set at the *Gateway In* blocks. Note that the *Output Sample Time* field of the *AIE to HDL* block is set to *Inherit from tready*.
