# Sobel Edge Detection
This example demonestrates an implemntation of sobel edge detection algorithm in Xilinx Model Composer.

This example uses the following Mathworks toolboxes.  
* [MATLAB Computer Vision System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html)  
* [DSP System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/dsp-system.html)

Sobel Edge Detection algorithm calculates the gradient of the image intensity in the x and y directions by convolving the image with a separable filter in each direction.
