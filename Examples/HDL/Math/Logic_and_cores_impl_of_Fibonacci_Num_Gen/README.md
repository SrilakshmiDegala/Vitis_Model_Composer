# Logic and Cores Fibonacci Number Generator

This design is a logic and cores implementation of a Fibonacci number generator. That is, given a non-negative integer n, it computes the recursively defined sequence x_0 = 1, x_1 = 1, ... , x_n = x_{n-2} + x_{n-1}.

This design should be compared to sysgenFIBONACCI_synth which implements the same computation in a more software-centric way. The two designs are functionally equivalent, and use the same amount of FPGA resources.
