# High Speed SSR FIR

This reference design can be used as a starting design point when efficient implementations of very high data rate (over 1 Gsps) Single Rate FIRs are required. This PL based design can be used in any modern Xilinx device - 7-Series/UltraScale/UltraScale+/Versal.

This Single Rate SSR FIR reference design illustrates a number of advanced Vitis Model Composer design techniques: 

-	This is a fully parameterizable design - you can control the filter order N, the number of clocks per sample SSR, the filter type (non/even/odd-symmetric), the input, output and coefficient fixed point quantization; you can set SSR and TAPS in Model Settings/Model Properties/Callbacks/InitFcnall the rest of the SSR FIR parameters can be set in the Model Composer block dialog
-	If desired, you can floorplan the DSP blocks directly from Vitis Model Composer
-	This is achieved through the use of Model Composer HDL Black Box flow, all these features are implemented in the underlying VHDL-2008 code; the reference design shows how to pass ports and parameters with generic sizes between Model Composer and VHDL code; the underlying VHDL-2008 code shows how to use arbitrary precision fixed point types, recursive component instantiations, how to instantiate DSP primitives independent of FPGA family (7-Series/UltraScale+/Versal) and floorplan them from VHDL code
-	The Vitis Model Composer design includes a top level Simulink self-checking testbench, which compares the fixed point HDL Black Box based implementation to a golden reference floating point model
-	This is a very high speed design, clock frequencies up to the maximum data sheet values of 741/891/1150 MHz in the fastest speed grade 7-Series/UltraScale+/Versal devices are possible
-	The design also shows a technique to avoid the Versal 795/824/872 MHz fMAX limitation due to SRL16 minimum pulse width spec
-	The VHDL code inside the Model Composer HDL Black Box can be instantiated stand alone in a Vivado RTL project. MATLAB and Vitis Model Composer are used here to illustrate the flow and make functional verification easier.

This design only works in Vivado 2022.1 or later.
