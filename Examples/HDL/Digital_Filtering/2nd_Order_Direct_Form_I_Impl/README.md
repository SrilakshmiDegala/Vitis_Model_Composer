# 2nd-order Direct Form I implementation

This design example shows two distinct FPGA implementations of a 2nd order IIR filter in Direct Form I, and compares them to the double precision Simulink IIR filter block.

IIR_Cmult is implemented using constant coefficient multipliers implemented in LUTs,

IIR_mult is implemented using embedded multipliers.

Multiple display blocks allow the user to visualize the Spectrum and Transfer functions of each implementation as well as the quantization error in the DISPLAY block.

All the variables such as data width, coefficient width, Sample period, and coefficient values are initialized in the sysgenIIR_PreLoadFcn.m file. The default setting use 12 bit data and coefficients
