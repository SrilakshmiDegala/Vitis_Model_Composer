# Multi-channel, folded implementation

This design demonstrates how multiple IIR filters can be implemented using a single time-shared second-order section (biquad). Specifically, 15 distinct IIR filters, each consisting of four cascaded biquads, are realized in a "folded" architecture that uses a single hardware biquad. Hardware folding is a technique to time-multiplex many algorithm operations onto a single functional unit (e.g. adder, multiplier). For low sample rate applications like audio and control, the required silicon area can be much reduced by time-sharing the hardware resources.

In this design, the several individual folding techniques are employed:

the biquad is time-multiplexed among fifteen channels
the biquad is time-multiplexed among four cascade stages for each channel
the biquad is implemented using two multipliers and a single adder instead of the straightforward 5 multipliers and 4 adders (a biquad output is calculated in every 5 system clock cycles).
The maximum clock frequency for the top-level design is device dependent. The speed for each channel (4-cascade-stage IIR filter) is maximum clock frequency for the FPGA( MHz) / (15 channels*4 biquads/channel*5 clks/biquad).
