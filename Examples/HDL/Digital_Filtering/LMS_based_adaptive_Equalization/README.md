# LMS-based adaptive equalization

This design shows a T/2 adaptive Fractionally Space Equalizer (FSE) operating on a 16-QAM data source with noise and filtering introduced in the channel model. The two 4-tap FIR filters are based on an SRL16E-based MAC implementation. Virtex-II dedicated multipliers are used in the complex multipliers blocks in order to provide optimal speed and resource utilization of the FPGA device.

The DHAT scope provides an X-Y plot of the I and Q filter outputs from within the FSE. As the simulation progresses, these symbols will converge as the error is reduced. The magnitude of the filter coefficients is shown in a vector scope as well. Increasing the simulation duration will allow better visualization of the adaptive FSE effects on the filter output.
