# Run Time Parameters (RTP)
These examples demonstrate modeling and simulation of Run Time Parameters in Model Composer. In Versal Adaptive SoCs with AI Engines, the processing system (PS) can be used to dynamically load,
monitor, and control the graphs that are executing on the AI Engine array. Even if the AI Engine
graph is loaded once as a single bitstream image, the PS program can be used to monitor the
state of the execution and modify the Run-Time Parameters of the graph. This is done through Run Time Parameters. 

## Examples
Here we demonstrate two exmaples:

- [A design with a scalar RTP input](rtp_scalar/README.md)
- [A design with a vector RTP input](rtp_vector/README.md)
- [A design with a asyncronous vector RTP input](rtp_vector_async/README.md)
 



## Knowledge nuggets
:bulb: An RTP input can be a scalar or a vector.
