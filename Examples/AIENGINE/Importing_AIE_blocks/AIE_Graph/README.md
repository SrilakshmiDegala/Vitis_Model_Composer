# Importing graph as a block

In this example we import a simple graph as a block into Vitis Model Composer. When you import a graph into Vitis Model Composer using the AIE Graph 
block, you need to create a .cpp file and instantiate the graph. You later have to specify this file in the block mask. 

## Knowledge nuggets

:bulb: Note the usage of the *Graph Search Paths* to specify the search paths.
