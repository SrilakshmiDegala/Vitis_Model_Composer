<h1>Lab 6: Hardware Validation of Versal Adaptive SoC Design</h1>
<p>This lab shows how to use Vitis Model Composer to perform validation
of an AI Engine design running on Versal Adaptive SoC hardware.</p>
<p>In Lab 5, we used cycle-approximate AI Engine simulation to simulate
the behavior of the AIE kernels. This gave us confidence that the
algorithm is functionally correct, but did not explore how the AI Engine
interacts with the Programmable Logic (PL) and Processing System
(PS).</p>
<p>Hardware validation is an important next step to test the Versal
Adaptive SoC design. Vitis Model Composer can be used to create a
hardware image for either a physical board or a hardware emulation flow
that simulates the full behavior of the Versal Adaptive SoC including AI
Engine, PL and PS.</p>
<p>When creating the hardware image, the input data samples that are fed
into the design during simulation in Simulink are collected. Likewise,
the output data samples from the design are also collected. The input
and output data are packaged as part of the hardware image and
downloaded to the hardware. The input data is fed into the design in
hardware, the output data is collected and compared with the output data
from simulation. This comparison is done by the PS in the device. Unless
something is wrong, the result should match bit by bit with the result
of the simulation because the simulation in Vitis Model Composer is
bit-accurate. The hardware runs independently of Vitis Model Composer,
and during the hardware run no information is communicated between Vitis
Model Composer and the hardware.</p>
<p><span class="emoji" data-emoji="warning">⚠️</span> This AI Engine Lab
can be done only in a Linux environment.</p>
<section id="procedure" class="level3">
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>This lab has the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Step 1, you will configure the Vitis Model Composer Hub block to
generate a hardware image to perform validation.</li>
<li>In Step 2, you will run hardware emulation to simulate the behavior
of the Versal Adaptive SoC design including AI Engine, PL and PS.</li>
<li>In Step 3, you will download the hardware image to a VCK190 board
and perform hardware validation.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="emoji" data-emoji="warning">⚠️</span> Steps 1 and 2 of
this lab can be completed without hardware. Step 3 requires a Versal
board such as the <a
href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck190.html">VCK190</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Images/Image06.png" alt="missing image" /></p>
<p>The <strong>HW System Type</strong> provides two options:
<strong>Baremetal</strong> or <strong>Linux</strong> flow.</p>
<ul>
<li>With a <em>baremetal</em> environment, the PS application is
compiled to run directly on the processor. The application must
integrate and manage the AI Engine graph and PL kernels directly without
the support of any operating system. AMD provides a standalone board
support package (BSP), drivers, and libraries for applications to use to
reduce development effort.</li>
<li>With <em>Linux</em>, the PS application is compiled to run on a
Linux operating system. AMD provides an ADF API to control control the
AI Engine graph and the Xilinx Runtime (XRT) API to control PL
kernels.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, refer to the <a
href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1076-ai-engine-environment/Programming-the-PS-Host-Application">AI
Engine Tools and Flows User Guide (UG1076)</a>. In either scenario,
Vitis Model Composer automatically generates all required source code
for the host application to execute the testbench and interact with the
Adaptive SoC device. <strong>We will use Baremetal flow for this
lab.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> has two options: <strong>hw</strong> or
<strong>hw emu</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>hw</em> generates a binary image (for baremetal) or an SD card
image (for Linux) with which to program the hardware.</li>
<li><em>hw emu</em> generates simulation artifacts to perform Vitis
hardware emulation. SystemC is used to simulate the AI Engine and PL
kernels, and QEMU is used to simulate the PS application. Hardware
emulation lets you obtain high-fidelity profiling data about the design
as it would run on hardware, without having access to a physical
board.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a
href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1076-ai-engine-environment/Simulating-an-AI-Engine-Graph-Application">Simulating
an AI Engine Graph Application</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not have access to a board and/or would like to
perform hardware emulation, select <em>hw emu</em> as the Target and
proceed to Step 2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have access to a VCK190 evaluation board (or another
Versal Adaptive SoC board), select <em>hw</em> as the Target and proceed
to Step 3.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="step-2-validation-using-hardware-emulation" class="level2">
<h2>Step 2: Validation using Hardware Emulation</h2>
<p>In this step, you will use Vitis hardware emulation to validate the
design. As stated above, this simulates the AI Engine kernels, PL
kernels, and PS application side-by-side. This allows you to gain
confidence that the design will run on the actual hardware without
requiring access to a board. However, running hardware emulation is
slower than running the design on the board itself.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On the AIE Hardware Flow tab of the Vitis Model Composer Hub
block, select <strong>Run hardware emulation after code
generation</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Generate</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/Image07.png" alt="missing image" /></p>
<p>This will take a substantial amount of time as the entire design (AI
Engine, PL, and PS) is compiled and synthesized. Alternatively, you can
leave the <strong>Run hardware emulation after code generation</strong>
option unchecked and Vitis Model Composer will only generate the AIE,
PL, and host source code along with a script and makefile to perform
hardware emulation outside of Vitis Model Composer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: To perform hardware emulation outside of Vitis Model Composer
after the hardware validation code has been generated, run the script
<code>./code_hw_emu/run_hw/src_ps/launch_hw_emu.sh</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After hardware validation is complete, the result is displayed in the
Progress window. The testbench indicates that all outputs match between
the Simulink simulation and the hardware emulation.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Image08.png" alt="missing image" /></p>
</section>
<section id="step-3-validation-on-hardware" class="level2">
<h2>Step 3: Validation on Hardware</h2>
<p>In this step, you will generate a BOOT.BIN binary hardware image,
load it on the board, and perform hardware validation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the AIE Hardware Flow tab of the Vitis Model Composer Hub block,
select <strong>Generate BOOT.BIN after code generation</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/Image09.png" alt="missing image" /></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Click <strong>Generate</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will take a substantial amount of time as the entire design (AI
Engine, PL, and PS) is compiled and synthesized. Alternatively, you can
leave the <strong>Generate BOOT.BIN after code generation</strong>
option unchecked and Vitis Model Composer will only generate the AIE,
PL, and host source code along with a script and makefile to build the
boot image outside of Vitis Model Composer.</p>
<p>After the binary image is generated, it is stored in the folder
<code>./code_hw/run_hw/src_ps/BOOT.BIN</code>.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Image10.png" alt="missing image" /></p>
<p>We will now prepare the board and download the hardware image to it.
This lab provides instructions specific to the VCK190.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Here we are assuming the board is physically connected to a
Windows machine and the BOOT.BIN is generated using Vitis Model Composer
on a Linux machine. The Windows machine and Linux machine are networked
together, and the <a
href="https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug908-vivado-programming-debugging/Connecting-to-a-Hardware-Target-Using-hw_server">AMD
Hardware Server</a> is run on the Windows machine to route data between
the board and the Linux machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Connect the power cable to the board.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect a USB Micro cable between the Windows host machine and
the USB JTAG connector on the target board. This cable is used for
USB-to-serial transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the SW1 switch is set to the JTAG boot mode and power
on the VCK190 board using the power switch as shown in the following
figure.</p>
<p><img src="Images/board.png" /></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once your board is set up, program the device as follows:</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>In Windows, click the search box on the taskbar and type Device
Manager, then select Device Manager from the Menu.</p></li>
<li><p>When the board is powered ON and connected to your machine
through the USB interface, determine the COM ports that are between the
VCK190 board and your computer from Windows Device Manager.</p>
<p><img src="Images/device_manager.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Use a Terminal application (e.g. Teraterm or Putty) to open up
COM port interfaces on these ports (COM4, COM5 and COM6 in the above
case at 115200 baud rate). Note that only one of these terminals will
print the output.</p>
<p><img src="Images/putty.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Ensure the Connection type is set to Serial.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Run Hardware Server on Windows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note : This step assumes that you have Hardware Server installed on
your Windows machine as part of Vitis or Vivado Installation. If you do
not have Hardware Server installed, please refer to the section <a
href="#How-to-Install-Hardware-Server">How to Install Hardware
Server</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open Windows command prompt and provide complete path to
<code>hw_server</code> application and hit <code>Enter</code>. You can
see the hostname and port number as highlighted below.</p>
<p><img src="Images/hw_server.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Launch XSDB and create a target connection to the host running
the hw_server.</p>
<p>a. On the Linux machine, open a new terminal and launch XSDB using
the <code>xsdb</code> file from the Vitis installation directory as
shown.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;AMD Install Directory&gt;/Vitis/&lt;Version&gt;/bin/xsdb</code></pre>
<p>b. From the XSDB prompt, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code> connect -url &lt;Hostname&gt;:&lt;Port_num&gt;
 ta 1</code></pre>
<p>Note : You should use the hostname and port number as highlighted in
Step 9. Do not prepend the hostname with 'TCP:'.</p>
<p>c. From within the XSDB prompt, navigate to the directory where
hardware device image has been generated.</p>
<pre><code> cd &lt;lab work directory&gt;/code_hw/run_hw/src_ps</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Program the device and run:</p>
<p>a. From the XSDB prompt, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>device program BOOT.BIN</code></pre>
<p>You will see following message in the XSDB prompt if the device
program is successful.</p>
<p><img src="Images/xsdb_prompt.png" /></p>
<p>b. This will run the design on the board. In the Terminal
application, you should see the log similar to the following. Here, the
hardware results are compared with the golden results.</p>
<pre><code>   ******************************** Test Results ********************************
   ****** Model Composer and Hardware outputs match for all 40944 samples for output signal Out1 *******
   ****** Test passed ********</code></pre>
<p>c. To re-run the results, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>    rst -system
    device program BOOT.BIN</code></pre></li>
