# Lab 6: Using a Vitis Model Composer HDL Design with a Zynq-7000 SoC

In this lab, you will learn how to export your Vivado¬Æ design with Vitis Model Composer HDL IP to a software environment and use driver files created by Vitis Model Composer to quickly implement your project on a Xilinx¬Æ evaluation board, running hardware with software in the same design.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will have learned:
* How to export your Vivado design with Vitis Model Composer HDL IP to a software environment ( Vitis‚Ñ¢ software platform).
* How Vitis Model Composer automatically creates software driver files for AXI4-Lite interfaces.
* How to integrate the Vitis Model Composer driver files into your software application.

### Procedure

This lab has two primary parts:
* In Step 1, you will review the AXI4-Lite interface and associated C drivers.
* In Step 2, you will export your Vivado design to a Vitis software environment and run it on a board.

## Step 1: Review the AXI4-Lite Interface Drivers

In this step you review how AXI4-Lite interface drivers are provided when a design with an AXI4-Lite interface is saved.
This exercise uses the same design as Lab 5: Using AXI Interfaces and IP Integrator.

1. Invoke Vitis Model Composer and use the **Current Folder** browser to change the directory to: <samp> \HDL_Library\Lab6. </samp>

2. At the command prompt, type open Lab6_1.slx. This opens the design as shown in the following figure.
<br><br><img src="Images/Step1/Step2.png">
<br><br>This design uses a number of AXI interfaces. These interfaces were reviewed in Lab 5: Using AXI Interfaces and IP Integrator and the review is repeated here with additional details on the AXI4-Lite register addressing.
    - Using AXI interfaces allows a design exported to the Vivado IP Catalog to be efficiently integrated into a larger system using IP integrator.
    - It is not a requirement for designs exported to the IP Catalog to use AXI interfaces. The design uses the following AXI interfaces:
        - An AXI4-Stream interface is used for ports `s_axis_source_*`. All Gateway In and Out signals are prefixed with same name (`s_axis_source_`) ensuring they are grouped into the same interface. The suffix for all ports are valid AXI4-Stream interface signal names (`tvalid`, `tlast`, and `tdata`).

3. Double-click **Gateway In** decrypt (or any of **reset**, **Keys[63:32]**, **Keys[31:0]**, **parity_err**).

4. In the Properties Editor select the **Implementation** tab.

5. Confirm the Interface is specified as AXI4-Lite in the Interface options.
<br><br> Also note how the address of this port may be automatically assigned (as the current setting of **Auto assign address offset** indicates), or the address may be manually specified.

6. Click **OK** to exit the Properties Editor.
<br><br>Details on simulating the design are provided in the canvas notes. For this exercise, you will concentrate on exporting the design to the Vivado IP catalog and use the IP in an existing design.

7. In the Model Composer Hub block, select **Generate** to generate a design in IP Catalog format.

8. Click **OK** to dismiss the Compilation status dialog box.

9. Click **OK** to dismiss the Model Composer Hub.

10. In the file system, navigate to the directory <samp> \HDL_Library\Lab6\IPI_Project\ip\drivers\HDL_DUT_v1_0\src </samp> and view the driver files.
<br><br>The driver files for the AXI4-Lite interface are automatically created by Vitis Model Composer when it saves a design in IP Catalog format.

11. Open file <samp> hdl_dut_hw.h </samp> to review which addresses the ports in the AXI4-Lite interface were automatically assigned.
<br><br><img src="Images/Step1/Step11.png">

12. Open file <samp> hdl_dut.c </samp> to review the C code for the driver functions. These are used to read and write to the AXI4-Lite registers and can be incorporated into your C program running on the Zynq¬Æ-7000 CPU. The function to write to the decrypt register is shown in the following figure.
<br><br><img src="Images/Step1/Step12.png">
<br><br>The driver files are automatically included when the Vitis Model Composer design is added to the IP Catalog. The procedure for adding a Vitis Model Composer design to the IP Catalog is detailed in Lab 5: Using AXI Interfaces and IP Integrator. In the next step, you will implement the design.

## Step 2: Developing Software and Running it on the Zynq-7000 System

1. Open the Vivado IDE:
    - Click **Windows > Vivado 2023.2.**
<br><br>In this lab you will use the same design as Lab 5: Using AXI Interfaces and IP Integrator, but this time you will create the design using a Tcl file, rather than the interactive process.

2. Using the Tcl console as shown in the following figure:
   - Type `cd C:\Xilinx\LAB6\IPI_Project` to change to the project directory.
   - Type source lab6_design.tcl to create the RTL design.

> üìù Note: If you have copied the tutorials to a different directory or changed the file names, you should update the Tcl file accordingly.
