# Rapid design exploration using Vitis Model Composer<a name="introduction"></a>

Within the Simulink environment, Vitis Model Composer offers a range of performance-optimized blocks that facilitate the design and implementation of DSP algorithms on AMD devices. The inclusion of the Vitis Model Composer AI Engine, HLS, and HDL libraries enables efficient algorithm exploration and greatly expedites the path towards production.

To learn more, visit the Vitis Model Composer [website](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-model-composer.html).

# Where should you start?
Are you interested in accelerating your development effort using Vitis Model Composer? Here is where to start:
* Learn the [basics](/Tutorials/Simulink_Basics/README.md) of Simulink. To use Vitis Model Composer effectively, you need to understand the basics of Simulink, 
a block diagram environment for multidomain simulation and model-based design.
* Go over the [tutorials](/Tutorials/README.md). The tutorials will give you a solid understanding of how to use the tool.
* Browse through many of the examples we have here. You can easily access these examples from within the tool. 


# What's new in 2023.2?
* Take a look at the latest [tutorial series](./Tutorials) on AI Engines. This set of tutorials provides an excellent introduction to AI Engines and guides you through the process of developing a DSP algorithm on AI Engines using Vitis Model Composer.
* The new [Channelizer](./Examples/AIENGINE_plus_PL/AIE_HLS/Channelizer) example implements a high-speed channelizer design using a combination of AI Engine and Programmable Logic (PL) resources in Versal devices.
* The [filtering in frequency domain]( /Examples/AIENGINE/Filtering_in_frequency_domain/) design showcases filtering in frequency domain in AI Engines and also shows how to increase the throughput using different techniques.
